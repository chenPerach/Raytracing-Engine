## Raytracing engine

this is a very simple raytracing engine.
it requires no more than the basic C++ libraries to run properly.

this code generates an .ppm image and then exits.

this raytracing engine was created based on [this tutorial](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki/Part-1:-understandable-raytracing)
